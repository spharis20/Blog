<h1> Agriculture</h1>


			<p1> This has been my absolute favorite part of the class. Learning about aquaponics and the different types of farming practices have been super eye opening. I had no idea that Chinatown set up their own parallel farming systems throughout the world until this class. I also had no idea what aquaponics was. Learning about fogponics, deep water culture, the kraty method, flood and drain and the nutrient film technique have been super awakening. We have so many options that can benefit our communities.</p1>


<h2> Technology</h2>


			<p2> The technology aspect of the class has been the hardest for me to grasp. I am kind of all over the place with what we are learning. Coding is something that I believe takes time to truly grasp but once you have it you are solid. I have however learned how to set up an html document. I can add headers, paragraphs, links, lists, and photos. I can tell by the end of this class I will be skilled at coding.</p2>

<h3> Construction</h3>


			<p3> We have not actually participated in any construction projects but our OSHA modules have taught us about the safe practices that we will need to look out for when we begin working. Things like hard hats and steel toe boots will be important for us when we are building our farms.</p3>

<h4> Hands-On</h4>


			<p4> Thus far in the hands-on department we have learned some of the tools we will be using on the farm. We learned a variety of tools from hammers to wrenches. Some of my favorites are the combo wrench, linesman, wirestripper, torpedo level, flat bar, wood chisel and pick mattock. I look forward to actually using those tools on future projects.</p4>
